For my project I decided that I wanted to make a portfolio of the photos I took and information that I learned during  
my summer study abroad experience in Florence. With this website I want it to be informative, easy to use and visually  
appealing. I also want to use this opportunity to share some of the photos and experiences I had. The website will also  
serve the purpose of allowing other people to learn from my experience I used a Bootstrap template that is the scroll down  
format that I want to use for my site. I have a top navigation bar that allows anyone on the site to easily navigate to the  
different informational tabs on the site. Each page has a blurb on the place and what I did there (some are still placeholder  
text for now) as well as 6 pictures with captions! Some still have placeholder captions. I wanted to make sure for the draft  
I had the template layed out and navigation how I wanted it and then that I had all my photographs. Although I used a bootstrap  
template I did most of the CSS myself. I created a CSS template for how all of the location places would look. This made it much  
simpler to add my content once I had spent time perfecting the layout for a singular location. I also decided to add an about  
section to show a photo of myself and explain a little more of what the website is about! I am really excited about how it has  
turned out. I have some prior experience but this is my first solo web development process so it has been a little slower than  
expected. I still have some stretch goals I am reaching for but I have already learned a lot and become a better front-end coder!
