For my project I decided that I wanted to make a portfolio of the photos I took and information that I learned during  
my summer study abroad experience in Florence. With this website I want it to be informative, easy to use and visually  
appealing. I also want to use this opportunity to share some of the photos and experiences I had. The website will also  
serve the purpose of allowing other people to learn from my experience I used a Bootstrap template that is the scroll down  
format that I want to use for my site. I have a top navigation bar that allows anyone on the site to easily navigate to the  
different informational tabs on the site. Each page has a blurb on the place and what I did there as well as 6 pictures with  
captions! When you hover over each photo the photo goes to grayscale. The grayscale indicates it is something you can click on  
Each photo has a website either information about visiting the place or some history on the location. Some photos were not of   
specific landmarks so I included some general sites that may help someone else hoping to plan a similar visit! Although I used  
a bootstrap template I did most of the CSS and responsive design myself. I created a CSS template for how all of the location   
places would look. This made it much simpler to add my content once I had spent time perfecting the layout for a singular location.  
I also decided to add an about section to show a photo of myself and explain a little more of what the website is about! I am really excited about how it has turned out. I have some prior experience but this is my first solo web development process so it has been  
a little slower than expected. I took my peer's advice for a few things such as background color and layout and made the site much  
more appealing than it viewed in the draft. I also reached my stretch goals of having a hover effect and clicking for more info.  
I was ambitious with the amount of content I wanted to provide and I am proud of what I was able to pull together.
