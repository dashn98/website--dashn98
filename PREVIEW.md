For my project I decided that I wanted to make a portfolio of the photos I took and information that I learned during  
my summer study abroad experience in Florence. With this website I want it to be informative, easy to use and visually  
appealing. I also want to use this opportunity to share some of the photos and experiences I had. The website will also  
serve the purpose of allowing other people to learn from my experience and hopefully include some links to further   
information, however this will only occur granted I have some spare time. I do have some HTML, CSS, JavaScript experience  
but this is my first solo project deploying my own website, so I am very excited. In this preview you will see the   
beginning stages of the design that I sketched out in my proposal. I used a Bootstrap template that is the scroll down  
format that I want to use for my site. I still have a lot to modify, obviously the content but I also have some format  
changes that I would like to make such as side bars for information and many more spots for photographs. Right now, I   
have the main photo and began filling in the top bar which will include quick links to the different pages which will   
be the different places I visited. I also have the title above the photo right now, but I would like it to be atop the  
photo and have the photo meet the title bar as I think that would be much more visually pleasing. I also deployed my   
website using GitHub pages. I am excited that this site will be live and I can share it with others. Anyone can access  
it now and see what I have thus far via the link on my GitHub!I am excited to see what everyone creates for this project.
