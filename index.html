      During May of 2018 I had the opportunity to study abroad in the beautiful city of Florence. My program was six weeks long and was through the Engineering School here at Pitt! I took two classes one in Italian Art History and one in Engineering of the Renaissance. I learned a lot through this trip, both from my classes as well as my day to day experiences. I was able to see many new cities, eat some delicious food and make friendships and memories I'll never forget! Check out my page to learn more about my trip!

      Florence was the homebase for my study abroad trip. I lived in a two bedroom apartment with two other students. We had a 15 minute walk to class each morning. Many of our classes included visits to museums around Florence. One Sunday of the month, all the museums were free, we saw Michaleango's the David, the Piti Palace, Boboli Gardens and even explored the Gucci Museum.

  One of my favorite days was when we visited the Duomo and got to climb to the top. The view was amazing! We also walked to the top of the Piazzale Michaleango one day which is across the river. We explored Ponte Vecchio, many churches and some great panini and gelato shops along the way!:)

      On one of our weekends we took a trip to Rome! We spent the first day exploring the Colleseum, Palladini Hill and the Trevi Fountain. The architecture was absolutely amazing. It was interesting to see such famous architecture that I had learned about many times before. As we walked through Rome there were many street performers that livened it up. There was so much to see in Rome I would love to go back!

      The second day in Rome we went to Vatican City. The Vatican museum was extremly crowded but stunning. I was able to see the Sistine Chapel and it was breathtaking. You were not allowed to take pictures inside it but pictures would not do it justice. The trip to Rome was packed but it was amazing to see all the history up close.

          During one of our first weekends we took a day trip to Pisa and Lucca. In Pisa there was not a whole lot to do. We walked from the train station to the Leaning Tower and saw some amazing views over the river. Seeing the Leaning tower was pretty surreal after seeing it so often photographed. The train tickets to and from Florence cost me a total of 20 Euros which amazed me how cheaply we could travel to such an iconic location.

          Our trip to the Amalfi Coast was the last weekend of the entire trip. This was one of my favorite places in Italy. In the Amalfi Coast we went to multiple locations. We went to Positano which is a really famous beach in Amalfi. We also spent a day in Capri, a half day in Pompeii and half day in Naples. Capri was my favorite, we spent part of the day exploring the town and beach and then took a boat ride around the island and visited the Blue Grotto.

        Venice, known for its gondola rides and bridges was really cool to see. Although they might not have quite as many bridges as Pittsburgh. It was really impressive to see just how much of Venice was just water and bridges. We saw a glass blowing exhibit as Venice is famous for its glass.

      We also took a gondola ride in Venice which really gave us the authentic Venice experience. The ride was extremely peaceful and we were able to see the ins and out of the city from a totally different perspective.
